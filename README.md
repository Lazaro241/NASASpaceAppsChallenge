# Impactor 2024 - Meteor Impact Prediction System

## NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

### Project Overview
This project aims to develop a comprehensive meteor impact prediction system for the NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024. Our solution focuses on tracking, analyzing, and predicting potential meteor impacts to help protect Earth from space threats.

### Team Information
- **Challenge**: Planetary Defense
- **Team**: [Your Team Name]
- **Event**: NASA Space Apps Challenge 2024

### Problem Statement
Space debris and meteor impacts pose significant threats to Earth and space infrastructure. This project develops tools and models to:
- Track near-Earth objects (NEOs)
- Predict potential impact trajectories
- Assess impact risks and damage potential
- Provide early warning systems

### Features (Planned)
- [ ] Real-time NEO tracking dashboard
- [ ] Impact probability calculations
- [ ] Risk assessment algorithms
- [ ] Visualization of trajectory predictions
- [ ] Early warning notification system
- [ ] Historical impact data analysis

### Technology Stack
